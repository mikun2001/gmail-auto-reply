## Overview

The Gmail-auto-reply App is a Node.js application designed to automate email responses during a user's unavailability. The app checks for new emails, sends replies to threads with no prior responses, and adds a label to the email threads. The application repeats this sequence at random intervals to simulate natural responses.

## Usage

# Install Dependencies:

npm install

# Run the Application:

npm start

## Detailed Specifications Libraries and Technologies Used

# Node.js:

The application is built on Node.js, a JavaScript runtime, providing an efficient and scalable environment for server-side development.

# Express:

Express is used to set up a simple web server for the application, allowing easy handling of HTTP requests.
Google APIs and OAuth2:

The application integrates with Google APIs, specifically the Gmail API, to interact with the user's email account.
OAuth2 authentication is implemented for secure access to user data.

# google-auth-library:

This library is utilized to handle OAuth2 authentication and token management for Google APIs.

# nodemailer:

Nodemailer is used to send automatic email replies in response to incoming messages during the user's vacation.

# readline:

The readline module is employed for interactive command-line input, facilitating the OAuth2 authentication flow.

## Areas for Improvement

# Security Enhancements:

Implement secure coding practices and consider additional security measures, especially when dealing with user credentials and tokens.

# Error Handling:

Enhance error handling to provide more detailed error messages and improve the robustness of the application.


# Code Modularity:

Consider breaking down the code into modular components for better maintainability and readability.

# Documentation:

Expand code comments and documentation to aid developers in understanding the codebase.

# User Interface (UI):

Consider building a basic web-based UI for the application to simplify user interaction, configuration, and monitoring.

# Testing:

Implement unit tests to ensure the reliability and correctness of individual functions and modules.
Configuration Management:

Incorporate a configuration management system for handling environment-specific settings, making the application more adaptable.
